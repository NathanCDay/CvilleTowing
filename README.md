Originally started as a time-series forecast of Cville's towing. And then it spilled into other Cville Open Data projects...

In order to keep mildly organized, I will be splitting up future Cvile Open Data projects into stand alone repos.

The Cville Crime Cast app from the Data Portal Kickoff is here on [shinyapps.io]( https://nathanday.shinyapps.io/CrimeCast/). God bless RStudio.
